# HarvardX-Capstone-Project-Choose-your-own

This capstone project consists in employing the R-programming and statistics skills obtained throughout the course as well as applying the learned machine learning techniques to predict red wine quality. A few machine learning algorithms were fit to the data to predict red wine sensory quality (a score between 1 to 10) in a test set using the inputs of a provided train set.

CapstoneCYO.R -> R Script that generates the data analysis
